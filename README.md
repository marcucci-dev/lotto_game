# Lotto Game
Lotto_game is a Python project that allows you to print up to 5 lotto game tickets on the screen.
For each ticket you will be asked for the type of bill (ambata, ambo, terno, quaterna, cinquina), the amount of numbers to generate (max 10 per bill), the "city" (aka "ruota") of the bill (Bari, Cagliari, Firenze, Genova, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Roma, Torino, Venezia and Tutte).
Numbers will be randomly generated in the range 1-90 (inclusive)

## Quick start
To launch the program, after downloading the sources, simply type from the command line:
